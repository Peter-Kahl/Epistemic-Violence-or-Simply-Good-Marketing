## Abstract

University marketing is often presented as a neutral or even celebratory activity, but this paper argues that it constitutes a site of epistemic violence—a subtle suppression of epistemic plurality through the aesthetic and rhetorical performance of excellence. Drawing on Fricker’s (2007) framework of _epistemic injustice_ and Dotson’s (2014) account of _epistemic oppression_, the paper situates institutional communication within structures of testimonial and _hermeneutical exclusion_. Integrating fiduciary theory (Frankel 2011; Kahl 2025), it advances the concept of fiduciary epistemic stewardship—a normative framework that redefines universities as trustees of epistemic trust, bound by duties of care, candour, loyalty, and prudence.

Through engagement with intercultural ethical traditions—Jewish _Tikkun Olam_, Islamic _Shura_ and _Masʾuliyah_, Christian _Diakonia_, Hindu _Ahimsa_, and Buddhist mindfulness—the paper formulates a global ethics of _epistemic non-violence_. It proposes a pedagogy of fiduciary dialogue, wherein communication becomes a relational and reflexive act rather than a competitive performance. The conclusion reinterprets marketing as a moral mirror, reflecting the institution’s epistemic conscience and its willingness to learn from its own representations. The study calls for universities to move from market rationality to fiduciary rationality: from self-promotion to stewardship of truth.
