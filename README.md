### Abstract

This essay interrogates the ethical and epistemic consequences of university marketing practices, particularly their reliance on rankings and promotional narratives. While such strategies are often presented as neutral or necessary tools for competition, they risk enacting subtle forms of epistemic violence by privileging quantifiable metrics and marginalising alternative forms of knowledge. Drawing on the concepts of epistemic injustice and fiduciary epistemic duties, the analysis highlights how institutional messaging can narrow the frameworks of what counts as valuable scholarship, thereby silencing plural epistemologies, especially those rooted in the humanities and historically marginalised groups. The essay proposes that universities, as fiduciary stewards of knowledge, should adopt practices of epistemic mindfulness and undertake regular epistemic audits to ensure inclusive and responsible knowledge governance. By situating the discussion within global ethical traditions, the piece advances a normative framework for universities to move beyond marketing imperatives towards epistemic justice.
